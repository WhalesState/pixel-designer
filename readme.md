# <center>PIXEL DESIGNER</center>

*`NOTE:`* You should run the project at least once from the editor before exporting, to generate icons, fonts and plugins.

## Made with <b>[PIXEL ENGINE](https://github.com/WhalesState/godot-pixel-engine/tree/pixel-designer)</b>
- To download the editor and the export/debug release templates you can fork this repo and it should build for all platforms, just make sure you are using the `pixel-designer` branch since the master branch is outdated.
